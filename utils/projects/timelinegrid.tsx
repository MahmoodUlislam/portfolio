            Building on my own a responsive web application,
            which had a catalogue of all company's servers, displayed in the

            Anyone logged could browse through lists of servers.
            Search and sort by name function were applied.
            App had system of accounts as well. Admins, technical and user ones.
            Admins could manage accounts by editing them, deleting and authorize
            (every new user had to be authorized by admin). Admins could also
            see what user is logged at the moment.<br/>
